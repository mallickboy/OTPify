</h1>
<!-- <h3 align="center">
A secure OTP and email delivery service built with Go Fiber, integrated with advanced AI/ML-based filtering using FastAPI to ensure accurate and reliable request processing.
</h3> -->

## Overview

**OTPify** is an AI-driven OTP and email delivery service designed to provide high-performance, scalable, and secure user authentication. The service is built using **Go Fiber** to handle OTP and email dispatch, ensuring excellent performance, especially in database management and high-concurrency scenarios. Additionally, **FastAPI** is integrated as a microservice to enable advanced AI-driven functionalities, including fraud detection and email classification using **OpenAI API** and **LLMs**.

## Key Features

- **Fast and Scalable OTP Delivery**:  
  Using **Go Fiber** for efficient OTP and email dispatch, optimizing system performance and scalability.
  
- **AI-Driven Insights**:  
  Leveraging machine learning and AI to detect fraud, generate rejection summaries, and provide real-time security insights through an interactive dashboard.
  
- **Microservices Architecture**:  
  **Go Fiber** powers the core OTP delivery functionality, while **FastAPI** serves as a microservice to process AI-based email analysis.
  
- **Future Domain-Based Authentication**:  
  Planned extension to offer serverless authentication services, allowing users to validate and authenticate using domain names for sending OTPs and emails securely.

## Technologies Used

- **Go Fiber**  
- **FastAPI**  
- **Python**  
- **Docker**  
- **JWT**  
- **Redis**  
- **Machine Learning**: TensorFlow, PyTorch, OpenAI API, LLMs

## Project Goal

With a focus on scalability, fraud prevention, and real-time analytics, **OTPify** is designed to meet the needs of modern applications that require secure and efficient OTP and email delivery solutions.

## Future Plans

- **Serverless Architecture**: Expanding to a serverless solution with domain-based authentication, enabling easy integration and enhanced security.
